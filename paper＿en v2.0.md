# The State as a Bottom Line: A Social-First Model of Political Structure

---

# Abstract

Modern political theory typically takes the state as its analytical starting point, treating society as either an object or a byproduct of governance. Historical evidence suggests that long-term political stability depends not on maximizing state capacity, but on preserving social structure and constraining the state to its appropriate role.

This paper proposes a bottom-up political model derived from society upward. Through comparative analysis of the French Revolution, Switzerland, Thailand, and Singapore, the state is redefined as the final safeguard of society rather than its daily ruler.

## 1. Problem Statement: Why Start from Society

Modern political discourse assumes the state as the primary actor. However, historical patterns show:

States can collapse while societies persist.

High state capacity often correlates with long-term fragility.

Core claim:

> Political analysis must start from society, not the state.


The state is a minimum safeguard constructed under extreme pressure, not the origin of social order.

## 2. Minimal Complete Social–Political Structure Model

Layered Structure (Bottom-Up)

### 1. Society

Spontaneous survival and relational networks

Family, neighborhood, industry, customs


### 2. People

Concrete carriers and practitioners of society


### 3. Religion / Belief

Ultimate meaning, restraint, sacrifice mechanisms


### 4. Intermediary Structures

Gentry, guilds, associations

Coordination, buffering, risk sharing


### 5. Symbolic Authority

Monarchy or equivalent

Temporal legitimacy connector


### 6. Government

Technical executor of state functions


### 7. State

Final sovereignty and violence boundary


### 8. Military

Physical carrier of bottom-line force


Key Criterion:

> Whether the state is constrained as a bottom-line structure or elevated into a daily governing.


---

## 3. State and Government Positioning

Derived Rules:

The state is not a social goal.

The state exists only to prevent total collapse under extreme threats:

External invasion

Internal violence

Fundamental order breakdown


When the state becomes:

Moral authority

Meaning provider

Sole distributor of resources


➡️ Intermediary layers collapse
➡️ Society is structurally compressed


---

## 4. Intermediary Layers and Social Risk Consumption

Intermediary layers perform three core functions:

### 1. Risk Buffering

Convert shocks into manageable fluctuations


### 2. Moral Regulation

Shame, responsibility, informal accountability


### 3. Resource Adjustment

Non-state redistribution


Without intermediaries:

Individuals face the state directly

Society enters a bare exposure state

Structural risk rises sharply


---

## 5. Entropy, Time, and Political Structures

Entropy (Social Science Definition):

> Irreversible time-cost required to maintain order.


Characteristics

Governments and states are high-entropy structures

Require continuous intervention:

Law interpretation

Fiscal balancing

Policy revision

Conflict arbitration


Conclusion:

> State instability is structural, not moral.


High-entropy systems must continuously consume social anti-entropy resources.


---

## 6. Why Symbolic Authority Is Low-Entropy

Symbolic authority (e.g., monarchy):

Low-frequency

Non-intrusive

Does not handle daily allocation


Functions

Seal legitimacy disputes

Provide temporal continuity


Once symbolic authority engages in:

Taxation

Administration

High-frequency governance


➡️ Rapid entropy accumulation
➡️ Structural collapse


---

## 7. French Revolution as a Structural Counterexample

Not merely a regime change, but a structural inversion:

State replaced intermediary layers

Systematic destruction of:

Church

Guilds

Local elites



Napoleonic System

Strengthened mobilization

Failed to reconstruct social intermediaries


Outcome:

Short-term state capacity ↑

Long-term social capacity ↓


---

## 8. Comparative Cases

Thailand

Monarchy provides temporal legitimacy

Government handles daily affairs

Real intermediary layers exist

Result: low efficiency, high resilience

---

Switzerland

Local autonomy

Guild traditions

Restrained state power

Result: low entropy without monarchy

---

Singapore

High-efficiency government

Absorbed intermediary fiscal roles

Society dependent on income stability

Result: high sensitivity to cycles and shocks

---

## 9. Structural Dilemma of Socialism

Core Misjudgment:

> Confusing centralization with anti-entropy.


Structural Facts

Society lacks unified will

“Public ownership” must be enforced via the state

Leads to state entropy escalation


Historical Pattern:

Short-term state strengthening

Long-term social atrophy

Systemic failure


---

## 10. Technological States and Modern Risk

Digital governance and AI:

Do not eliminate entropy

Only shift damage modes


When technological dividends decline:

Structural risks concentrate

Stability depends on social self-coordination capacity


---

## 11. Structural Solutions Without State Expansion

### 1. Limit State Intervention Frequency

Define strict trigger conditions

State as last resort, not first tool


### 2. Rebuild Intermediary Layers

Avoid nationalized risk pooling

Restore local and professional risk-sharing


### 3. Replace Mobilization with Time Structures

Symbolic authority

Stable constitutions

Local autonomy


### 4. De-incentivize Fiscal Expansion and War

Hard budget constraints

War capability limits


### 5. Define Technology Boundaries

Technology delays but cannot remove structural tension


---

## Conclusion

Political durability depends on:

Preserving intermediary layers

Limiting state frequency

Maintaining temporal order


Understanding the entropy of the state is more critical than any specific institutional design in an era of rising uncertainty.
