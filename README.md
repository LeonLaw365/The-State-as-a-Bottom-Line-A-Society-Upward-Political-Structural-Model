# The State as a Bottom Line

This repository contains a full-length political and social theory paper proposing
a social-first structural model of the state, using entropy as an analytical framework.

## This project explains:

- Why stronger state capacity can coincide with weaker societies  
- Why intermediate social layers determine long-term systemic stability  
- Why governments and states are structurally unstable over time  
- Why individual resilience depends on embedding oneself in low-entropy social structures rather than relying on state solutions
